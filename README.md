# Dental Office Patient Portal
<h2>Problem & Solution</h2>
<p>Cal Poly Pomona Dental wished to optimize their operations pertaining to payment and billing, since their current operations require patients to pay at the counter immediately after any treatment done at that stage; they also see an opportunity to create a patient database to streamline their operations.
To solve this issue, we designed a dedicated patient portal which implements a fully-functional billing and payment subsystem that allows the patient to view and pay for invoices anywhere they are.</p>

<h2>Technologies Utilized</h2>
- Java </br>
- JavaFX </br>
- MySQL </br>
- SceneBuilder </br>
- JDBC </br>
- Visual Studio Code</br>
